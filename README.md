# Event Calendar - iCal / jCal event calendar

This is the beginning of an event calendar component that is iCal and jCal compatible. I am currently working on a Node JS server implementation combined with a UI for web browsers. 

On the front end it features both a simple input form and a custom input form that supports repeating events. The simple form allows the user to specify basic data like start date, end date and a simple repeat frequency such as "daily". The custom form provides a broader range of support for icalendar properties.

The back end is a Node JS module that saves data to couchdb.

This project is in its infancy so I don't suggest using it for anything other than experimental stuff for now.
